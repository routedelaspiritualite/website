"oua ata el mala 3ala 7oubihi"
    "3ala 7oubihi"  -> first meaning : you love money. Second meaning: based on their love for allah, they gave. Based on their love of being good, they gave. They understood that they have to fight the greed inside of themselves. Our greed is toxic and takes away all the good from us => we need to control it. The way to control it is by giving. When you give, it heals the greed off you and makes you normal again. The more charitable you are, the more likely you are to maintaining a good character. If you are meaner or greedier, or angrier, give things you love to purify yourself. In another part of the Quran, Allah says "lan tanalou el birra 7ata tounfi9ou fi ma tou7iboun" -> "you are not going to reach goodness until you spend out of what you love". For example, the new clothes you got for Eid, it isn't just about money it is for other things too like time. Who do you give to? "dhawi el 9orba" -> "those who possess closeness": it could be relatives, parents cousins simblings children, but it can also be friends and aquaintances that you know need help. When giving to anybody, you do it for yourself, not for the person you are giving to. Islam teaches us that being charitable is selfish. It is a kind of "Tawassaw bil 7a9" because you giving them is them helping you. The prophet sallalahou 3alayhi oua sallam said "ma na9assamaloun min sada9a" -> "wealth never goes down when you give charity". Allah says in the Quran : "Whatever you give will be refunded back to you".

What Allah tells us is that the most important thing to being good is our faith, not having a beard of a 7ijab or knowing all the Quran by heart etc. It is invisible, it is inside your heart. The second thing that Allah mentions to being good is that you give wealth despite your own love of wealth. And you give it to people who are close to you. Because people around you are the hardest to deal with, the least impressed and the least grateful. Like for tawassaw bil 7a9, it is the same thing,

"dhawi el 9orba oua el yatama" -> and the orphans. We have no idea who the orphans are. We need to know other families in our community to know who the orphans are. Try to make acquatainces with people. The masdjid is a place to know each others and socialize within our community and it helps us know who are the people in need. We cannot live up to that aya if we don't make the effort to know people.

Then Allah says "Oua el masakin" -> "masakin" comes from "masaka" and "sakana", there is two roots that are together. People that are stuck in poverty and can't help their situation: like someone who got a disability and cannot find work.

"Wa ibna sabil" -> "the son of the path/road" which means "the traveller". Someone who has been travelling for a long time. In an islamic society, hotel industry wouldn't do so well because people literally compete over to have people stay at their house. We need host people and be accomodable. People who come are a gift to us. Back in the day, the resting house was the masjid.

"Wa sa'iline" -> "those who ask". Allah mentions a whole list of people who do not ask first and then those who ask because we are supposed to be the kind of culture that gives so much that people doesn't have to ask. Asking should be a last resort.

"Wa firri9ab" -> people whos next are chained. It means people who are enslaved, inprisonned, in debt and can't get out of it.

"Wa a9ama salat" -> those who make prayer.  Even though we think about salat first for a good muslim, it is not mentionned as number one in the list. The first thing was the convictions, the beliefs and where they come from. As a result of your belief, how much you care about people around you and how much do you give despite your love of money.

"Wa ata zakat" -> This is not about zakat, it is different. It was not about the legal minimum, It was actually just about us being a giving person all the time. And of course you give zakat and you make prayer.

A really important idea : In many cultures there are two opposite definitions of being good : religious good or morally good. Difference between the two : religiously good means if it's a girl she wears hijab, she takes a lot of islamic classes, she memorizes Quran, she prays etc; if it's a guy, he got a beard, dresses very traditionally, does a lot of worship, prays tahadjud check the meat is Hallal, they read ingredient. Morally good people don't necessarily pray or have hijab or whatever. They are nice to people, courteous, honest, respectful, truthful, really good people. What happens over time is that these two kind of goods become two groups of people that have different and conflicting definitions of good: religiously good people would say: "These guys don't pray, they do not were hihjab blablabla" and the ;orally good people would say "These guys pray and go to Hajj every year but are mean people and they steal and blablabla" and one group starts hating the other.
-- 25:00 -- These aya combines moral and religious goodness into one and makes them inseparable. Any muslim who thinks these two are separable doesn't understand the Quran's concept of being good.

"wa a9ama salat oua ata zakat" is a figure of speech in the Quran. It is the Quran's terminology for all the laws of Islam because half of Islam is what you do for Allah - salat - and the other half is what you do for people - zakat - and both benefit us => Laws of Islam. It covers the entire spectrum of Islam because in order to make salat you need to have to have pure intentions, pure clothes, you need to be pure (wuduh), you need to eat Hallal; in order to give zakat your money needs to be Hallal so you need to earn it in a Hallal way => it encompasses a whole way of living.

Now Allah moves to something else and talks about something larger. "wa el moufouna" which is the first plural of the aya. "moufouna" means "fulfill". "Wal moufouna bi 3ahdihim ida 3ahadou " -> fulfillers of promises whenever they make a mutual promise. When 2 people make an agreement with each others and both understands what the other owes then you have to fulfill the agreement. "3aaahadou" comes from "mou3ahada" which means an agreement when both parties understand. In Islam you need to be a clear communicator and make sure the other person understand what is expected from them. => When you lend people money, it is better to write it down. "Moufouna" is a switch to the plural and it is powerful because we can be a society that fulfills promises when all of us become serious about agreements. => Say no when we can't.

"wa sabirina fil ba'sa'i oua dhara'i wa 7ina el ba's" -> "and over and above everything else the people who are persevering and patient and constant when it comes to time of conflict", in other words there are tensions against islam, social pressure against you etc. "wa dhara" -> "they stay constant even in times of great difficulty" el dhara is also economic difficulty. "wa 7ina el ba's" -> even in the battlefield you will stick to your commitments. the "in" in "sabirin" makes the translation to "over and above everything else"."mouta9oun" -> people who protect themselves. "ita9a" in arabic means to take protection for yourself

The purpose of sharing this aya was to show you two things:
  1 - difference between moral goodness and religious goodness and how both of them are combined in this aya
  2 - good in the eyes of Allah starts with belief then goodness to people then the obligations to Allah 3azawadjal. it is a matter of priority.
