# Surat luqman (31) - suite

## Ayat 12 (suite)

"wa man kafara fa ina Allah ghaniyou el 7amid" translate as "and whoever were to be ungrateful, then certainly Allah is free of need". This is a very powerful statement made by Allah and lets try to understand it. Allah is saying that he does not need me to be grateful to him and he does not need me for anything. People ask the question "why does Allah need me to thank him?". "ghani" means "someone who is independent" and has no need of you. The only person who is in need is us: we need to breathe, we need to have our heart beating etc and we do not thank Him for that. We can never thank Allah enough for what He has done. We don't even know the ways Allah is protecting us, we just have no idea. Allah says in the Quran "dja3ala 3alaykoum 7afadha" which means "he put gardian angels on you". These angels are full time on you just to take care of you and protect you. These are the angels taking care of the breaks not failing when you are driving, they are taking care of the drunk person driving on the road not hitting you etc. Allah doesn't need us but we need him and this is why he is "ghani". 
Then, Allah adds "7amid" which refers to someone who praised and shown appreciation **on his own**. In other words, you don't need to show him praise and appreciation because it is true of him even if no creation exists. Even if Allah did not create anything, no earth, no human being nothing, Allah would still be praised. He doesn't need creation to show him gratitude. If we, as human beings, are praised, we are called "Mahmoud". When you say Mahmoud, it actually means that someone praised you, or someone thanked you. 7amid is the state of being praised, even if no one praised you. Allah doesn't need anything or anyone to praise him. 

## Aya 13

> وَإِذْ قَالَ لُقْمَانُ لِابْنِهِ وَهُوَ يَعِظُهُ يَا بُنَيَّ لَا تُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ ۖ إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ - 31:13

> And [mention, O Muhammad], when Luqman said to his son while he was instructing him, "O my son, do not associate [anything] with Allah . Indeed, association [with him] is great injustice."

Let's make a link to sourat al Asr about the fact that Luqman gives his son advice: "wa tawassaw bil haq". Being grateful to Allah is part of sourat al Asr "ila lahdida amanou oua 3amilou sali7at" because being grateful is part of iman. "oua houa ya3idouhou" -> "while he was trying to council him" => the overall lesson is to find the right time to talk to people. There is an opportunity to talk to people at the right place, and the right time and circumstances to council people in truth. The second lesson is that since the word "houwa" is mentionned, it acknowledges the fact that it needs to be the father who gives advice to his son because otherwise the son will be impacted by other things like his friends, television for example. As a father, I should preempt all these influences and be the primary source of truth.
